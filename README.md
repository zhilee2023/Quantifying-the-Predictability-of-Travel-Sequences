# Quantifying the Predictability of Travel Sequences Using a Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder

This repository provides the code associated with the paper *Quantifying the Predictability of Travel Sequences Using a Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder* (VQ-VAE). The code primarily focuses on the first experiment of the paper, which investigates the generation of two-dimensional Gaussian-Markov sequences and the application of VQ-VAE to model the predictability of these sequences.

## 🧪 Experiment 1: Gaussian-Markov Sequence Generation and Predictability Analysis

In this experiment, we generate synthetic 2D Gaussian-Markov sequences that emulate stylized travel patterns. These sequences serve as the input to our **Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)** model, which quantifies behavioral predictability through the estimation of rate-distortion curves.

- `data_gen.py`: Generates 2D Gaussian-Markov sequences.
- `experiment1.py`: Applies VQ-VAE to the generated data and plots the rate-distortion curve.

### 📊 Dataset Generation

The synthetic dataset simulates a discrete-time Gaussian-Markov process with the following characteristics:

- **Transition Matrix**: Specifies the linear dependency between consecutive states.
- **Mean and Covariance**: Defines the parameters of the Gaussian distribution from which the noise is sampled at each time step.

To generate a new dataset:

```bash
python data_gen.py

### 📈 Running the VQ-VAE and Plotting Rate–Distortion

Once the dataset is generated, run the following script to apply the VQ-VAE model and produce a rate-distortion curve:

```bash
python experiment1.py
